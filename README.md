# holochain-fed-wiki-proxy
converts federated wiki style http requests to holochain fed wiki compat requests

Must be running an instance of https://github.com/Holochain/fed-wiki, and then you can run this as well. If running `hcdev web` on a different port besides 4141, change the value of the `domain` var to use your port.

To run, just `node index.js`
